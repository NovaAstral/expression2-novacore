# expression2-novacore
Random functions for Expression2 that I've made

Entity:resizeEntPhys(vector scale) - Sets the scale of the entity using vector (Is WIP so doesn't work visually, but mostly works physics wise)

createNaqBoom(vector pos,number yield) - Creates a Naquadah Bomb explosion from Carter's Addon Pack (if you have it) at pos and with yield. You must be an admin to use it.
